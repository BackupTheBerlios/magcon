MagCon Readme

MagCon reads tracks from your Magellan GPS and exports them to memopad. It was tested on a SporTrak Pro, but should work on all SporTraks, all Meridians and the 315. If it doesn't, or works on another device please contact me.

Usage:
1. Please read and accept the license.
2. Install MagCon using your favorite synctool.
3. Start it and follow the onscreen instructions.
4. After downloading a track, MagCon exports it to the memopad application.
5. You can convert the downloaded track to Magellan MapSend format using the 2mag tool which is included in this package.


2mag Readme

In a cmd-shell (also known as "Dos Box") run "2mag memofile mapsendfile trackname"
