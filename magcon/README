MagCon Readme

MagCon reads tracks from your Magellan GPS. 
Waypoints are read as well, but can't be exported at the moment.
It was tested on a SporTrak Pro, but should work on all SporTraks, all Meridians and the 315. If it doesn't, or works on another device please contact me.

Usage:
1. Please read and accept the license.
2. Install MagCon using your favorite synctool.
3. Start it and follow the onscreen instructions.
4. Timeout means interbyte timeout. The higher the value the faster the communication.
5. You can convert the downloaded track to Magellan MapSend or other formats using the 2mag and 2gpx tool which are included in this package.


2mag Readme

After syncing your Palm locate then file named track.pdb (substitue "track" with the trackname you chose).
In a cmd-shell (also known as "Dos Box") run "2mag track.pdb mapsendfile trackname" where trackname is the name you want to show up in MapSend.

2gpx Readme

After syncing your Palm locate then file named track.pdb (substitue "track" with the trackname you chose).
In a cmd-shell (also known as "Dos Box") run "2gpx track track.pdb track.gpx" to create a gpx-tracklog.
Use "2gpx csv track.pdb track.csv" to ouput data in cvs-format
