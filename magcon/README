MagCon Readme

MagCon reads and writes tracks, routes and waypoints from and to your Magellan GPS. 
It was tested on a SporTrak Pro, but should work on all SporTraks, all Meridians and the 315. If it doesn't, or works on another device please contact me.

Usage:
1. Please read and accept the license.
2. Install MagCon using your favourite synctool.
3. Start it and follow the onscreen instructions.
4. Timeout means interbyte timeout. The higher the value the faster the communication.
5. You can convert the downloaded track to Magellan MapSend or other formats using the magcon-client tools which are available as a separate package. There are also tools to convert routes and waypoints to a format that can be used by GPSBabel (http://gpsbabel.sourceforge.net/)
